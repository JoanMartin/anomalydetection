Getting started
===============

Install
*******

The installation is quick and simple using pip.

.. code-block:: bash

    # Anomaly Detection Framework needs a home directory to read settings from.
    # In case is not provided, $HOME/anomdec will be used
    export ANOMDEC_HOME=~/anomdec

    # Install from pypi using pip
    pip install anomalydetection

Sandbox
*******

After installation, you can start a dashboard instance and play with
the sandbox, there is no configuration required to do this.

.. code-block:: bash

    # Start a dashboard to play with sandbox
    anomdec dashboard

You will get an output similar to this one.

.. code-block:: text

    2018-07-09 12:37:51,930 - anomalydetection.anomdec.Anomdec:35 - INFO - Starting anomdec
    2018-07-09 12:37:51,930 - anomalydetection.anomdec.Anomdec:38 - INFO - Run dashboard
    2018-07-09 12:37:51,933 - anomalydetection.common.config.Config:50 - WARNING - Cannot load configuration.
    [Errno 2] No such file or directory: '~/anomdec/anomdec.yml'

.. note::

    Ignore the Config ``WARNING`` log if you are following this *Getting started* guide.
    This is because we have not configured any signal to process yet.


Devel mode
**********

You can also run a devel mode. For this, you need to deploy a docker-compose.yml file.
This will deploy an Apache Kafka, Apache Zookeeper and a Google PubSub emulator. The
*devel mode* processes a random signals that are randomly generated by itself.

.. code-block:: bash

    # Export kafka advertise hostname
    export KAFKA_ADVERTISED_HOST_NAME=localhost

    # Download docker-compose.yml file
    curl -o docker-compose.yml https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bluekiri/anomalydetection/master/docker-compose.yml

    # Start docker enviroment
    docker-compose up

    # In another terminal, start the devel mode
    anomdec devel

You should see how messages are pushed to Kafka and PubSub backends to ``stdout``.

Open the `dashboard

on your browser to visualize how data is processed in real time.
